# 🧠 How It Works

Players simply type:

```bash
.startergear
```

The module then:

1. Checks whether the module is enabled
2. Validates the player's class
3. Checks if the character already used the command
4. Grants bags
5. Grants riding skills
6. Grants mount item
7. Grants Dread Pirate Ring
8. Grants class-specific heirlooms
9. Stores the character GUID in the database

---

## 🐴 Riding at Level 1

The module uses:

```cpp
Player::learnSpell()
```

This bypasses level validation without modifying the core.

The included SQL patch additionally changes:

```sql
RequiredLevel = 1
```

to Celestial Steed (ID:54811) it's the default mount item.
> if you want to change the mount in .conf file, you need to patch the new mount in your database, so level 1 player can learn the mount.
